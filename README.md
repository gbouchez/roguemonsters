# Rogue Monsters

A roguelike game in python using tcod.

Very loosely based on
[this python 3 + libtcod tutorial](http://rogueliketutorials.com/libtcod).

## Concept

The main concept of the game (which is not implemented yet...) is to "switch"
between monsters. You can invest in your current monster if you think it is
strong enough, or try to take control of another one if it looks tougher than
yours !

### This code is bad

I have almost no experience in python, and I'm kinda throwing ideas at the
code to have something playable right now while thinking "meh, I'll clean that
later", so, yes.

I may be implementing some things in a "non-pythonic" way because I don't know
the pythonic way to do things. Don't hesitate to open a pull request
and explain how things could be made more pythonic (same if I use tcod in a
strange way) !
